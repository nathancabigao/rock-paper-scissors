# Rock Paper Scissors

My implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors project featured on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). This is a basic JavaScript program where the user plays 5 games of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.

## How to Play
1. Open the browser's JavaScript Console to see the results of the game.
2. Enter Rock, Paper, or Scissors into the prompt window.
3. Repeat for the 5 rounds, and the console will show the results of the game, with scores.
