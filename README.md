# Rock Paper Scissors

My implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors project featured on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). This is a basic JavaScript program where the user plays rounds of Rock Paper Scissors against a computer until a score of 5 is reached.
